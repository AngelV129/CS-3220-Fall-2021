        <h1>The Challenge</h1>

        <p><u>This year's ProgFest will be different from prior years.</u>  
            It consists of data structure and algorithmexercises within 
            Android applications. The first part of the day will<br> 

            be a 2 hour hands-on workshopon creating very basic Android applications. 
            The rest of the day will involve creating Android gamesthat require 
            the use of relatively<br> 

            sophisticated algorithms and data structures.</p>


        <ul>
            <li>
                All exercises will be done in Java (with a small amount of XML) - 
                a good grasp of Java is required.
            </li>

            <li>
                Knowledge of at least these Java data structures is needed: 
                HashMaps, ArrayLists, Sets, Trees, Tries. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Knowledge of recursion would be helpful, along with algorithms such as 
                breadth-first search and depth-firstsearch.
            </li>

            <li>
                Knowledge of basic text Java IO would also be helpful.
            </li>

            <li>
                Practice using Android Studio and deploying Android apps to an emulator
                 will make doing the projectseasier.
            </li>
        </ul>
