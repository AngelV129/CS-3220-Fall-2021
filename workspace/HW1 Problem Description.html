    <h2>CS3220 Homework 1</h2>

    <p>Please deploy your application on CS3, and package your project in a zip file and submit it to Canvas. The
        open-source software tool <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> can be used to create the zip file. Please
        also create and submit an HTML file <em>hw1.html</em> which contains a hyperlink to your application
        on the CS3 server.</p>

    <p>A local art teacher has a small business that offers painting lessons for kids. There are two types of lessons:
        group lessons and individual lessons. Kids taking group lessons are divided into groups
        with up to 5 kids per group. The kids in a group will attend group lessons together, and they cannot attend
        lessons given to other groups. Parents pay for their kids' lessons by buying "lesson packs". A lesson pack
        includes 6 or more lessons - either individual or group but not mixed.</p>
    
    <p>In this semester you are going to develop a web-based system that helps the teacher to manage his (or her)
        business. In this assignment we will focus on students and groups.</p>

    <p>1. Home Page (10pt)</p>
    <p>When the application is requested without any parameter, it displays two links (or buttons) like the following:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#">Students</a> | <a href="#">Groups</a></p>
    <p>Clicking on <em>Students</em> should take the user to the student listing page, and clicking on <em>Groups</em>
    should take the user to the group listing page.</p>
    
    <p>2. List Student (20pt)</p>

    <p>The student listing page displays all the students in the system. For example:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#">New Student</a></p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Student</th>
                    <th>Age</th>
                    <th>Parent</th>
                    <th>Email</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>John</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>Sue</td>
                    <td>sue@gmail.com</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Jane</td>
                    <td>9</td>
                    <td>Sue</td>
                    <td>sue@gmail.com</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Luke</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>Steve</td>
                    <td>steve@gmail.com</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Tina</td>
                    <td>7</td>
                    <td>Paula</td>
                    <td>paula@gmail.com</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>3. List Groups (30pt)</p>

    <p>The group listing page displays all the groups in the system. For example:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#">New Group</a></p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Group</th>
                    <th>Members</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Minnows</td>
                    <td>John, Luke</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Dolphins</td>
                    <td>Jane</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>4. New Group (25pt)</p>

    <p>Clicking on <em>New Group</em> takes the user to a page where a new group can be added. For example:</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <td><input type="text" /></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2" scope="row"><button>Add</button></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Note that after a new group is added, the application should redirect the user to the group listing
        page.</p>

    <p>5. New Student (35pt) </p>

    <p>Clicking on <em>New Student</em> takes the user to a page where a new student can be added. For example:</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <td><input type="text"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Birth Year</th>
                    <td><input type="text"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Parent Name</th>
                    <td><input type="text"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Parent Email</th>
                    <td><input type="text"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Group</th>
                    <td><select>
                            <option></option>
                            <option>Minnows</option>
                            <option>Dolphins</option>
                        </select>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2" scope="row"><button>Add</button></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Note that the dropdown list must be dynamically generated based on the groups currently in the system.
        Specifically, the dropdown list should include all the groups (including the ones added using the
        <em>New Group</em> function) that have less than 5 students in the group. The group field for a new student
       can be empty, which means the student is not in any group, or in other words, the student will only take
       individual lessons. </p>
    <p>Also note that birth year is entered when adding a student, while in the student listing, age is displayed
        instead of birth year. Age is calculated as (current year - birth year).
    </p>
    <p>After a new student is added, the application should redirect the user to the student listing page.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As I said in class, the vast majority of web applications can be considered as <em>data + operations on the
            data</em>, so first identify the data in this application and create the corresponding classes (e.g. Student and Group),
            then identify the operations in this application, e.g. list students, add student, and so on.</li>
        <li>Create one servlet for each operation. If an operation involves form processing, use <code>doGet()</code>
            to display the form and <code>doPost()</code> to process the form.</li>
        <li>To focus on the main functionality, we will assume that the users will always provide proper input - in
            other words, you do not need to implement any input validation.</li>
        <li>Changes made by the users (e.g. new students and groups) need to be stored in application scope but do not
            need to be saved to a file. Those changes will be lost after the application is unloaded or reloaded, and
            that's OK for this assignment.</li>
        <li>Do not spend too much time beautifying the user interface - you can do that in later assignments when we use
            JSP.</li>
    </ul>
